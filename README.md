# Introduction to Machine Learning

- [Let me just read the intro](#static-intro)
- [Let me play with the intro](#dynamic-intro)

## Static intro

Walk through the static notebooks:

- [Machine Learning Begins](/notebooks/machine-learning-begins.ipynb)
  - Machine Learning concepts

- [Machine Learning Continues](/notebooks/machine-learning-continues.ipynb)
  - Basic code example to solve the [Kaggle's Titanic Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

## Dynamic intro

Follow the next steps to clone, install, execute, open, and edit the notebooks on your own machine:

### Install

Install [Anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/#detailed-installation-information) installer with Python 3.

### Execute

Clone the repository, and run `jupyter notebook` on the project's root directory.

Jupyter will automatically be opened on your browser at `localhost:8888/`.

### Open

Drill down to `/notebooks`, and open the following notebooks (in sequence):

- `machine-learning-begins.ipynb`
  - Machine Learning concepts

- `machine-learning-continues.ipynb`
  - Basic code example to solve the [Kaggle's Titanic Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
